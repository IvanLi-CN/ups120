# Smart Battery Firmware – Protection & Charger Bring-up Design

## Scope

This document captures the software architecture that now boots the STM32L051C8
smart-battery firmware into a safe operating state. The firmware sequence
initializes the TI **BQ76920** protection IC (CRC variant @ 0x08) ahead of the
**SC8815** charger so that the pack’s safety envelope is validated before any
power stage is enabled. It also describes the shared I2C bus topology, gating
controls, and telemetry loops that underpin bring-up.

## Hardware Interfaces

- **I2C2 – INNER bus (PB10/PB11)**: Operated at 100 kHz with DMA1_CH4/CH5 and
  serviced through the shared I2C2 interrupts. A global `StaticCell` stores the
  bus so multiple async drivers can borrow it via `embassy-embedded-hal`
  shared-bus mutexes. Both the BQ76920 (fixed `0x08`) and SC8815 (`0x11`) ride
  this bus.
- **SMBus Alert (PB5) & Alert GPIOs**: Reserved for future SMBus/alert handling;
  interrupt lines `PB1` (BQ alert) and `PB2` (inner bus INT) are wired for EXTI
  wakeups.
- **CE (PA10)**: Active-low charger enable. Held high during safety bring-up
  and whenever no SC8815 activity is required. The firmware asserts it low only
  when the charger must be configured, telemetry must be sampled from the
  SC8815, or charging is actively commanded.
- **PSTOP (PA9)**: Active-high gate for the SC8815 power stage. Remains high
  until charger programming succeeds and stays an emergency kill path for any
  detected charger fault.
- **EXIT_SHIPMODE (PA1)**: Push-pull GPIO used to wake the BQ76920 from ship
  mode with a high pulse before configuration retries.

## Initialization Sequence

1. Configure MCU clocks (LSE on) and instantiate CE/PSTOP outputs high to keep
   the charger path disabled. Prepare the `PA1` wake GPIO so the BQ76920 can be
   nudged out of ship mode if it fails to respond on the first attempt.
2. Bring up I2C2 with DMA and register it inside a `StaticCell<Mutex<…>>`. This
   shared handle feeds lightweight `I2cDevice` wrappers for each peripheral at
   the moment they need bus access.
3. Initialize the global pub/sub channels; capture the BQ-specific publishers so
   alerts and measurement frames can be streamed once the protection loop runs.
4. Enter a blocking loop that repeatedly attempts to configure the BQ76920 via
   `Bq769x0` with CRC enabled:
   - First boot attempt performs an immediate configuration using per-cell
     thresholds (OV 3.65 V, UV 2.50 V), 15 A short-circuit, 10 A discharge
     overcurrent, and `rsense = 3 mΩ` to match the hardware shunt.
   - If this initial communication fails, pulse `EXIT_SHIPMODE` high, hold the
     line asserted for a full 500 ms to exit ship mode, then drop it low before
     retrying configuration.
   - Subsequent failures fall back to a 1 s retry cadence without repeating the
     ship-mode pulse. MOSFETs and the charger stay disabled until configuration
     succeeds.
   - On success, spawn the asynchronous `bq76920_task`, which keeps verifying the
     pack, manages FET states, and publishes telemetry.
5. Once the protection stage is alive, wait 10 ms, drive CE low, and delay
   another 100 ms to satisfy the SC8815 wake timing.
6. Reassert `PSTOP` high immediately before configuring the SC8815. Create an
   `I2cDevice` for SC8815 over the same mutex-protected bus, call `init()`, push
   the charger configuration (10 mΩ sensing, 800 mA limits, Charging mode,
   450 kHz switching, 60 ns dead time, VINREG 11.5 V, VBAT ratio forced, with
   trickle/termination enabled), disable OTG, and start ADC conversions. Any
   error forces CE/PSTOP high and exits early.
7. Hold PSTOP high for an additional 100 ms, then drive it low to energize the
   power stage. Runtime monitoring continues to guard against faults.

## Runtime Behaviour

- **Protection loop**: The spawned `bq76920_task` reuses the shared bus to fetch
  measurements, confirm register integrity, and assert FET control. Configuration
  verification failures keep both FETs disabled and log detailed diagnostics. The
  task acquires a fresh measurement frame once per second and republishes pack
  voltage, pack current, per-cell voltages, temperatures, MOS status, and alert
  bits via the `BQ76920_MEASUREMENTS` pub/sub queue so downstream tasks (such as
  the charger controller and USB bridge) always have up-to-date data.
- **Pack-voltage supervision**: When the BQ76920 reports healthy status, the
  firmware holds the discharge FET enabled whenever protection flags are clear so
  the SC8815 VBAT sense always tracks the pack. Only undervoltage, short, or
  overcurrent faults—and the 12.5 V cutoff—force the discharge FET open. If
  charging is permitted by the BQ76920, the firmware consults the reported pack
  voltage to decide SC8815 gating: below 17.0 V, drive the CE/PSTOP sequence to
  begin charging; at 18.5 V, halt charging even if other conditions remain true;
  at 12.5 V or lower, immediately disable output FETs and charger gates to
  prevent deep discharge. A
  hardware erratum leaves
  the ALERT pin permanently asserted, so software now forces the charge FET on
  whenever voltage and protection limits are satisfied, even if the
  `OVRD_ALERT` flag latches back in. The alert bit is still logged, but it no
  longer vetoes the charge path.
- **Charger loop**: The SC8815 owner task wakes every second, pulls the most
  recent BQ76920 measurement frame from its subscriber queue, and decides whether
  the charger path should be enabled (17.0 V start, 18.5 V stop, 12.5 V cutoff).
  The resulting decision is tracked as *charge expected* — i.e. CE is driven low
  and PSTOP released only while the policy wants energy flowing. When no
  charging or SC8815 telemetry is required, CE remains high so the charger is
  electrically idle and no I²C transactions are attempted. To configure or
  energize the charger, the task reasserts PSTOP high, drops CE low, waits
  100 ms, and only then releases PSTOP to energize the stage. During this window
  CE stays low to keep the SC8815 responsive for status/ADC reads; any
  over-voltage stop, permission withdrawal, or absence of telemetry demand
  raises CE/PSTOP again. OTP or VBUS/VBAT short flags trigger an immediate safety
  response—raising PSTOP/CE and leaving the loop active for inspection.
- **Charging confirmation**: Each SC8815 ADC frame is filtered to decide whether
  real charge current is flowing. A running confirmation counter asserts
  *charging confirmed* whenever `IBAT` stays above 100 mA for three consecutive
  samples, and deasserts after three samples below an 80 mA hysteresis band.
  The pub/sub alert payload exposes both `expected` and `confirmed` flags so UI
  elements (LED task, USB reporting, diagnostics) can distinguish “policy wants
  charging” from “measurable current is present” and warn on mismatches instead
  of guessing from noisy instantaneous readings.
- **Telemetry plumbing**: Measurement publishers returned by `shared::init_pubsubs`
  keep per-device channels decoupled. The BQ76920 producer updates its queue at
  1 Hz, the SC8815 task pushes charger telemetry on the same cadence, and any
  consumer (USB bridge, logging task, etc.) can subscribe to combine them into an
  `AllMeasurements` snapshot without every task polling individual peripherals.
- **Balancing policy**: The BQ76920’s autonomous cell balancing is limited to one
  cell at a time. The firmware withdraws a cell from balancing once it falls
  below 3.300 V and applies a 5 mV hysteresis band before allowing that cell to
  re-enter, preventing chatter.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate SC8815 telemetry into the pub/sub fabric so higher-level logic can
  arbitrate charging without relying on logs.
- Implement SMBus alert servicing on PB1/PB5 to react more quickly to protection
  trips rather than polling.
- Add explicit recovery routines (e.g., staggered retries or manual clear hooks)
  once the protection IC reports a cleared fault, keeping the safety-first
  posture that now gates charger bring-up.
